Basic To Do List App

While the original version of this was practice with basic session work and using POST variables, I have revised it to more fully      
demonstrate OOP practices and integration of MySQL database to store saved lists.                                                 

Lists are stored in JSON string format, allowing the potential of creating an API with the app. Functionality includes adding tasks to 
the currently displayed list and removing completed tasks. The currently displayed list can be saved. If the currently displayed list  
is a previously saved list, updating will overrwrite the list in the database with the modified JSON string.
